I'm Anas Jamil, a Software Engineering student with five years of hands-on experience in software development. Proficient in languages such as C++, Python, and Java, I've showcased my coding skills during an impactful internship, where I contributed to operational efficiency.

I completed a project for a multi-million dollar company, upgrading AI-enhanced facial recognition entry systems with automated access from anywhere and anytime for faster repairs. This project significantly improved the efficiency and reliability of the company's security infrastructure.
